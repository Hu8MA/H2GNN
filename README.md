## Overview

This repository provides documentation and a structural guide for **H²GNN** (Hierarchical Hypergraph Neural Networks), designed to predict drug-drug interactions. The framework leverages two complementary network stages:

1. **Chemical Network (Stage 1)**: Binary classification of drug interactions using K-mer representations of SMILES strings
2. **Metabolic Network (Stage 2)**: Multi-class classification (86 interaction types) using embeddings transferred from the chemical network

The hypergraph structure enables modeling of higher-order relationships between drugs, capturing complex interaction patterns that traditional pairwise graph-based methods may miss.

| **Total Training Time** | 142 min | **18.6 min** |
| **RAM Usage** | 0.46 GB | 0.29 GB |
| **Hardware** | CPU (2-core) | CPU (2-core) |

### Training Time Comparison (Metabolic Network)

| Model | Training Time | Hardware |
|-------|:-------------:|:--------:|
| **H²GNN (Ours)** | **18.6 min** | CPU |
| GCN (2-layer) | 75.6 min | GPU (T4) |

✅ **4-12× faster** than baselines while achieving superior accuracy  
✅ **No GPU required** — runs efficiently on CPU

*Note: Single-layer GCN/GraphSAGE on CPU failed to converge. Baselines required deeper architectures and GPU hardware.*

## Ablation Studies

| Ablation | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| **Without Chemical Embeddings** | Performance dropped significantly — validates hierarchical transfer learning |
| **Reversed Attention Flow** | Major performance decline — confirms edge-centric attention is optimal for DDI |
| **Modified Class Weighting** | Trade-off observed — current strategy achieves best balance |

### Generalization Capability

The model demonstrated remarkable generalization by recovering **94.7%** of intentionally excluded interaction types within top-3 predictions — despite never seeing them during training. This suggests H²GNN captures underlying multi-mechanistic pharmacological relationships.
